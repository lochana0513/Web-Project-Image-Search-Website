# Unsplash API Integration Project

## Overview

I created this website to improve my skills with web APIs. Using the Unsplash API, I've been learning how to integrate APIs into web projects effectively. Also, I hope to increase my knowledge about web APIs through these kinds of projects.

## Features

- **Image Search**: Search for high-quality images using the Unsplash API.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works well on different devices.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive user interface for a seamless experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup language used for structuring the web content.
- **CSS3**: Styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: For making the website interactive.
- **Unsplash API**: To fetch images based on user queries.

## Installation



 **Change the API Key**:
    - Sign up on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and get your API key.
    - Open the `script.js` file in your preferred code editor.
    - Locate the line where the Unsplash API key is defined, typically something like:
      ```javascript
      const accessKey = 'YOUR_UNSPLASH_API_KEY';
      ```
    - Replace `'YOUR_UNSPLASH_API_KEY'` with your actual Unsplash API key.
    - Save the changes.

 Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the website.

## Usage

1. Enter a keyword in the search bar.
2. Click the search button to fetch images from the Unsplash API.
3. Browse through the search results displayed on the page.
